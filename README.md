`tabula-py` is a simple Python wrapper of [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java), which can read table of PDF.
You can read tables from PDF and convert into pandas's DataFrame. tabula-py also enables you to convert a PDF file into CSV/TSV/JSON file.

You can see [the example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chezou/tabula-py/blob/master/examples/tabula_example.ipynb) and try it on Google Colab, or we highly recommend to read [our document](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) especially for FAQ.

# Requirements

- Java 8+
- Python 3.5+

## OS

I confirmed working on macOS and Ubuntu. But some people confirm it works on Windows 10. See also [the document for the detailed installation for Windows 10](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#get-tabula-py-working-windows-10).

# Usage

- [Documentation](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [FAQ](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) would be helpful if you have issue
- [Example notebook on Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chezou/tabula-py/blob/master/examples/tabula_example.ipynb)

## Install

Ensure you have Java runtime and set PATH for it.

```bash
pip install tabula-py
```

## Example

tabula-py enables you to extract table from PDF into DataFrame and JSON. It also can extract tables from PDF and save file as CSV, TSV or JSON.

```py
import tabula

# Read pdf into list of DataFrame
df = tabula.read_pdf("test.pdf", pages='all')

# Read remote pdf into list of DataFrame
df2 = tabula.read_pdf("https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/raw/master/src/test/resources/technology/tabula/arabic.pdf")

# convert PDF into CSV file
tabula.convert_into("test.pdf", "output.csv", output_format="csv", pages='all')

# convert all PDFs in a directory
tabula.convert_into_by_batch("input_directory", output_format='csv', pages='all')
```

See [example notebook](./examples/tabula_example.ipynb) for more detail. I also recommend to read [the tutorial article](https://aegis4048.github.io/parse-pdf-files-while-retaining-structure-with-tabula-py) written by [@aegis4048](https://github.com/aegis4048).
